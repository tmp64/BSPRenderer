# This is an example of a map lighting configuration.

# The file and its contents are optional and are not required to make a lightmap.
# But you'll need it to tweek the lighting to improve quality.

# List of build profiles that set speed and quality options.
# Options here will override options in rad_profiles.yaml.
# Same syntax as in rad_profiles.yaml.
# The order of application is (bottom ones will override options from the top ones)
#     rad_profiles._common
#     profiles._common
#     rad_profiles.profile_name
#     profiles.profile_name
profiles:
    # This is the base profile
    _common:
        luxel_size: 32 # This means luxel size is 32 unless a profile explicitly overrides it
    
    # This will override only bounce_count in "full" profile
    full:
        bounce_count: 64

# The gamma value for gamma correction. Don't really need to change it.
gamma: 2.2

# Reflectivity multiplier
reflectivity: 1

# Configures direct sunlight. If not present, light_environment is used.
sunlight:
    pitch: 120              # Pitch of the light
    yaw: -45                # Yaw of the light
    color: [128, 64, 128]   # Light color in gamma space
    brightness: 250         # Brightness multiplier
