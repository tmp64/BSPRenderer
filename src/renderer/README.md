Renderer
========
Contains BSP world surface renderers and font renderer. Handles shaders and materials.

- BaseRenderer - base class for all world renderers. Prepares list of surfaces to draw.
- PolygonRenderer - draws surfaces as randomly colored polygons.
- TexturedRenderer - draws surfaces as textured polygons. If available, applies lightmaps generated by *rad*.
